Workshop for first-year Population Biology students
-----------------------

This repo will contain files for workshop/pdf for incoming pop bio students.

Ideas for workshop topics:
* basic probability theory (expectation, variance, covariances, correlations, CV, CLT, law of large numbers)
* R programming (What is R, R studio, calculator, pulling in data, data types, for loops, if else loops)
* linear algebra (vectors, matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Perrron-Frobenius)
* relevent bits of calculus
* dynamical systems
* statistics
* basic population models (discrete vs continuous, exponential growth, logistic, pop gen model)
* stochasticity
* simulations
