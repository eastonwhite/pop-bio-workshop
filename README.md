Workshop for first-year Population Biology students
-----------------------

This repo will contain files for workshop for incoming pop bio students. The goal is to bring students up to the same level before the start of their first year core class. The focus here is on technical skills---mostly mathematics, statistics, and programming. These skills are used throughout the core, especially the first quarter. Faculty would need to spend less time reviewing basic material (e.g. introducing R) if students had an intensive bootcamp before Fall quarter. 

Ideas for workshop topics:
* basic probability theory (expectation, variance, covariances, correlations, coefficient of variance, central limit theorem, law of large numbers)
* R programming (What is R, R studio, calculator, pulling in data, data types, for loops, if else loops)
* linear algebra (vectors, matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Perrron-Frobenius)
* relevent bits of calculus
  * basic differentiation and integration
  * Taylor series approximations
* dynamical systems - finding equilbriums and performing linear stability analysis
* basic statistics (simple linear regression, Generalized linear models)
* basic Bayesian statistics (material from Richard McElreath and Brian Moore)
* simple population models (discrete vs continuous, exponential growth, logistic, pop gen model)
* scaling laws
* stochasticity (types of noise, simple branching process, Markov chains)
